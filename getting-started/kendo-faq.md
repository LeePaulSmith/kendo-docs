# Kendo UI FAQ

Note: The complete list of FAQs for Kendo UI can be found on the [Kendo UI Website](http://www.kendoui.com/faq/faq.aspx)

## What is Kendo UI?

Kendo UI is a HTML5, jQuery-based framework for building modern HTML apps. Kendo UI combines the best of emerging HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript technologies with robust, cross-browser techniques to deliver a framework that is both powerfully rich and broadly compatible with older browsers.

Kendo UI combines everything that a developer needs to build a rich JavaScript app, eliminating the traditional challenge of manually researching and combining all of the needed plug-ins, frameworks, and libraries needed to build apps. Kendo UI includes rich UI controls for desktop, mobile and data vizualization, a JavaScript DataSource, fast Templates, cross-device Drag and Drop API, Globalization, Validation and MVVM framework extensions, and more.

## Who should use Kendo UI?

Kendo UI is for all HTML developers. Kendo UI can be used with (or without) any server-side technology, making it the perfect front-end for every modern, browser-based HTML app. Kendo UI only requires jQuery. After that, everything that's needed is included.

## What are Kendo UI widgets?

Kendo UI widgets are part of the Kendo UI Framework. Kendo UI widgets are grouped into three collections:

Kendo UI Web for touch-enabled desktop development
Kendo UI DataViz for desktop and mobile data vizualizations
Kendo UI Mobile for mobile app development, including PhoneGap deployment
All widgets complement the tooling you need for modern HTML5 and JavaScript development.

The Kendo UI Framework provides more than UI, and in the future Kendo UI will offer additional tools to modern HTML developers.

## How do you use Kendo UI?

Kendo UI is a pure JavaScript framework, so using Kendo UI is as simple as referencing JavaScript and CSS resources on your page. Once Kendo UI is configured on your page, the rich API gives you everything you need to initialize and configure an application.

## How is Kendo UI licensed? Is it open source?

Kendo UI Web is dual-licensed, Commercial and Open Source (GPLv3), while Kendo UI DataViz and Kendo UI Mobile are commercial-only.

The Commercial license includes full source, professional support, access to the latest Kendo UI hotfix builds, and priority influence on the [Kendo UI roadmap](http://www.kendoui.com/roadmap).

To determine which Kendo UI Web license is appropriate for your project, please consult with your legal counsel.

## Is Kendo UI based on jQuery UI?

No, Kendo UI is not based on jQuery UI. Kendo UI has been built from the ground-up to deliver a rich HTML5 app framework that is highly tuned for performance and positioned to rapidly evolve.

You can use jQuery UI with Kendo UI without conflict.

## Why doesn't Kendo UI use [insert your favorite JavaScript library]?

When building Kendo UI, we wanted to ensure that the out-of-the-box features were highly-tuned to the tasks at hand and capable of maximum performance. We also wanted to minimize external dependencies so that Kendo UI can be quickly evolved based on feedback. To do that, Kendo UI provides many of its own implementations for core framework features.

That said, there are some great JavaScript libraries available for building HTML apps, such as [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com), [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.com), and jQuery Templates.

Kendo UI is designed to be a good JavaScript neighbor. It provides extensibility points to make it simple to plug-in your favorite JavaScript library if you want to replace the out-of-the-box implementation. Don't miss the [online Integration demos](http://demos.kendoui.com/web/integration/index.html) showing you how to use Kendo UI with external libraries.

## Does Kendo UI offer mobile UI controls?

Kendo UI Mobile targets mobile devices in particular, providing native-like experiences for end users automatically, without any extra coding. Furthermore, Kendo UI Mobile apps can be compiled and deployed on app stores via tools lik [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com/) and [Appelerator Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/), giving you access to device APIs, like camera, accelerometer, and more.

Additionally, Kendo UI Web provides full support for mobile devices and touchscreen input.  

## What does the "Kendo" name mean?

Kendo literally means, "Way of the Sword". Like the popular Japanese martial art of the same name, Kendo UI embodies the vigorous spirit of building modern HTML applications. Kendo UI is the modern HTML developer's sword that will help with disciplined JavaScript app development.

## How can I share feedback about the Kendo UI?

The best ways to share feedback are either via the [Kendo UI UserVoice portal](http://kendo.uservoice.com/forums/127393-kendo-beta-feedback) or in the public forums on [kendoui.com](http://www.kendoui.com/forums.aspx).
